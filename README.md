# GreetKit

[![CI](https://github.com/hksw-io/GreetKit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hksw-io/GreetKit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A reusable SwiftUI welcome sheet for iOS and macOS apps in the HK Softworks portfolio.

Pure SwiftUI — the consumer owns state (loading, error, dismissal). Works with any state management approach (TCA, `@Observable`, `@State`).

The package and import name is `GreetKit`. Public view and content APIs intentionally use the
domain language `Greet...`, for example `GreetView`, `GreetContent`, and
`GreetPrimaryRoute`.

## Usage

Implement `GreetContent` with your app's strings and icon, then drive the view with bindings and callbacks:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import GreetKit

struct MyGreet: GreetContent {
    var appIcon: Image? { Image("AppIconImage") }
    var title: Text { Text("Welcome to MyApp") }
    var subtitle: Text? { Text("Here's what makes it great.") }
    var features: [GreetFeatureItem] {
        [
            GreetFeatureItem(
                id: "tap-to-flip",
                systemImage: "hand.tap.fill",
                label: "Tap to flip",
                description: "Review cards with a simple tap."),
        ]
    }
    var primaryRoutes: [GreetPrimaryRoute] {
        [
            GreetPrimaryRoute(id: "permissions"),
            GreetPrimaryRoute(id: "sample-data"),
            GreetPrimaryRoute(id: "notifications"),
        ]
    }
    var primaryButtonText: Text { Text("Get started") }
    var primaryRouteNextButtonText: Text { Text("Next") }
    var primaryRouteDoneButtonText: Text { Text("Finish") }
    var skipButtonText: Text? { Text("Skip for now") }
    var errorAlertTitle: Text { Text("Something went wrong") }
    var errorOKText: Text { Text("OK") }
}

struct RootView: View {
    @State private var isLoading = false
    @State private var errorMessage: String?

    var body: some View {
        GreetView(
            content: MyGreet(),
            isLoading: $isLoading,
            errorMessage: $errorMessage,
            onPrimary: { /* analytics or setup before routes open */ },
            onSkip: { /* mark first-run flow complete, dismiss */ },
            onPrimaryRoutesComplete: {
                /* dismiss the welcome flow or mark setup complete */
            },
            primaryRouteDestination: { route in
                switch route.id {
                case "permissions":
                    PermissionsSetupView()
                case "sample-data":
                    SampleDataSetupView()
                case "notifications":
                    NotificationSetupView()
                default:
                    EmptyView()
                }
            })
    }
}
```

On macOS the view carries a window-shaped minimum and ideal size so a sheet opens at sensible
Mac proportions. Override it from the presenting code when an app wants something else:

```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showingGreet) {
    GreetView(...)
        .presentationSizing(.fitted)
}
```

For a simple welcome sheet, omit `primaryRoutes` and `primaryRouteDestination`. The primary and skip callbacks can then dismiss the sheet directly.

For a setup flow, provide `primaryRoutes` and `primaryRouteDestination`. `onPrimary` fires first, then the library opens the first route with an in-sheet transition. Do not dismiss from `onPrimary` when using routes. Finish in `onPrimaryRoutesComplete` after the last route. `primaryRouteNextButtonText` and `primaryRouteDoneButtonText` customize the route controls. A single follow-up step is a chain of one — the button reads Done and the route completes the flow.

GreetKit does not include a separate "next steps" card/list primitive. If the primary button should continue into setup, model that as a route chain; if the app needs additional cards, build them in the consuming app or in the destination views.

## Backgrounds

The default background is the system sheet surface. Use `greetBackground(_:)` when an app needs a more branded first-run experience:

```swift
GreetView(
    content: MyGreet(),
    isLoading: $isLoading,
    errorMessage: $errorMessage,
    onPrimary: {},
    onSkip: {})
    .greetBackground(.animatedGradient())
    .greetStyle(GreetStyle(tint: .indigo))
```

Built-in options:

- `.system` — the default. Draws nothing, so the presentation's own surface shows through: a sheet keeps the material the platform gives it.
- `.softGradient` / `.softGradient(brand:)` — a restrained brand-derived background tuned for readable first-run content.
- `.animatedGradient(brand:motion:)` — an opt-in smooth full-surface animated gradient. It uses the style tint by default, adapts its tones for light and dark mode, and automatically becomes static when Reduce Motion is enabled.
- `.custom { context in ... }` — a fully custom SwiftUI background, including a plain `LinearGradient` of your own colors. Use `context.reduceMotion`, `context.reduceTransparency`, `context.colorSchemeContrast`, `context.brandColor`, and `context.colorScheme` to keep custom backgrounds consistent and accessible.

```swift
.greetBackground(.custom { _ in
    LinearGradient(
        colors: [.blue.opacity(0.18), .mint.opacity(0.12), .clear],
        startPoint: .topLeading,
        endPoint: .bottomTrailing)
})
```

Destination views can still draw their own backgrounds. If they do, that local destination background appears above the GreetKit background.

Every background spans behind the pinned footer and button area, including `.system`. Scroll indicators are hidden on iOS, where a swipe and the scroll edge effect already say the content continues, and left to the system on macOS, where the scroller is how a window tells you there is more below.

`GreetStyle.tint` is the default brand color for `.softGradient` and `.animatedGradient()`. Pass `brand:` when the background should use a different brand color from the controls:

```swift
GreetView(
    content: MyGreet(),
    isLoading: $isLoading,
    errorMessage: $errorMessage,
    onPrimary: {},
    onSkip: {})
    .greetBackground(.animatedGradient(brand: .pink))
```

The supporting tones are derived from that one color — washed toward the platform surface, which lifts them in light mode and deepens them in dark. An app that needs exact control over every tone should use `.custom { context in ... }` and draw the gradient itself.

Use `motion:` when the default dancing gradient should be calmer or more expressive:

```swift
GreetView(
    content: MyGreet(),
    isLoading: $isLoading,
    errorMessage: $errorMessage,
    onPrimary: {},
    onSkip: {})
    .greetBackground(.animatedGradient(motion: .expressive))
```

The built-in presets are `.subtle`, `.standard`, and `.expressive`. Stronger motion moves the color field farther and faster; it does not change the colors, opacities, or blur, so choosing a calmer pace never means a paler sheet. For finer control, pass `GreetGradientMotion(strength:)`; values are clamped from `0` to `2`, and `0` keeps the animated-gradient color field static.

GreetKit pins the footer with `safeAreaBar(edge:)` and hands the fade over overflowing content to the platform's scroll edge effect, so the treatment matches whatever the OS does elsewhere.

## Styling

Use `greetStyle(_:)` to set the brand color while keeping the library's layout, typography, and motion:

```swift
GreetView(
    content: MyGreet(),
    isLoading: $isLoading,
    errorMessage: $errorMessage,
    onPrimary: {},
    onSkip: {})
    .greetBackground(.softGradient)
    .greetStyle(GreetStyle(tint: .indigo))
```

`GreetBackground` controls the surface behind the sheet content. `GreetStyle` carries the brand color: the view applies it with `.tint`, so the prominent glass button and the feature icons take it from the environment, and the built-in gradients derive their palette from it. Leave it `nil` for the system accent.

Text roles are deliberately not overridable. Title, subtitle, feature rows, and the skip button use the system label hierarchy, and the primary button is the system prominent glass button — so the platform supplies the pressed, hovered, focused, disabled, and Increase Contrast treatments, and picks a label color legible against your tint. If an app needs a fully bespoke surface, use `.custom { context in ... }` for the background and style the destination views it owns.

## State ownership

The view is purely presentational:

- Give every `GreetFeatureItem` and `GreetPrimaryRoute` a stable `id`. These IDs preserve SwiftUI identity and are used for routing and analytics.
- `isLoading: Binding<Bool>` — when `true`, the primary button shows a progress spinner and both buttons are disabled.
- `errorMessage: Binding<String?>` — when non-nil, the view presents an alert. Setting it back to `nil` (or letting the user tap the OK button) dismisses the alert.
- `allowsInteractiveDismissal` — defaults to `true`. Set it to `false` only for setup flows that must block swipe or window dismissal.
- `onPrimary` / `onSkip` — fired on tap. Your state layer handles the rest.
- `primaryRoutes` / `primaryRouteDestination` — optional chained follow-up routes opened by the primary button with in-sheet slide transitions. The package supplies customizable Next and Done controls. For a single follow-up step, give `primaryRoutes` one route.

Route navigation state is intentionally transient and owned inside `GreetView`; persist only completed setup state in your app. Destination builders are generic at the public API and type-erased internally so call sites can return different SwiftUI views without exposing that plumbing.

`GreetFeatureItem` has `Text` and `LocalizedStringResource` initializers. Both require an explicit `id`, because `features` is normally a computed property and a generated identity would change on every evaluation.

## Accessibility

The library supplies no user-facing copy of its own, including for VoiceOver. While `isLoading` is `true` the primary button announces `primaryButtonLoadingAccessibilityValue`, which defaults to `Text("Loading")` — override it on your `GreetContent` to announce a localized string:

```swift
var primaryButtonLoadingAccessibilityValue: Text {
    Text(String(localized: "onboarding.action.loading"))
}
```

Feature icons and the app icon are hidden from VoiceOver; feature labels carry the header trait and read separately from their descriptions. Reduce Motion removes the feature reveal animation, the route slide transitions, and the animated gradient's movement.

The built-in gradient backgrounds flatten themselves under Reduce Transparency or Increase Contrast: the color wash is damped and more of the opaque base shows, so text contrast no longer depends on where a gradient blob happens to sit. Custom backgrounds get the same signals through `GreetBackgroundContext`.

Return triggers the primary action, including Next and Done inside a route chain. Escape triggers the skip action, but only when `skipButtonText` is non-nil and `allowsInteractiveDismissal` is `true` — a blocking setup flow stays blocked, and Escape never fires `onSkip` when there is no skip button on screen.

## Local development

Run the package tests from the package root:

```sh
swift test
```

The iOS build path is not covered by `swift test`, so check it too when touching platform-conditional code:

```sh
xcodebuild -scheme GreetKit -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build
```

CI runs all three on every push and pull request.
